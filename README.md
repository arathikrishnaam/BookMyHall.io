## Book My Hall

If you've ever tried to book a hall at a college or university, you know the pain. Paperwork, phone calls, waiting for approvals, and inevitably someone else books your time slot while you're still filling out forms. We built Book My Hall to fix this mess.

## What This Does

Book My Hall lets faculty and club leaders book halls online instead of dealing with paper forms. Administrators get a clean dashboard to approve or reject requests, and everyone can see what's already booked on a public calendar. No more double bookings, no more confusion.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login/signup system with role-based access control
- **Pre-approved Users**: Only authorised faculty and club leaders can make bookings
- **Smart Conflict Detection**: Automatic checking with a 60-minute buffer between bookings
- **Admin Dashboard**: Streamlined approval/rejection workflow for administrators
- **Public Calendar**: Real-time view of approved bookings using FullCalendar
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface using Bootstrap

## Architecture

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for auth, bookings, and admin operations
- **Middleware**: Role-based access control and request validation

### Frontend (React)
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state management

- **Calendar**: FullCalendar integration for booking visualization
- **UI**: Bootstrap for responsive design
